They currently have no automation at all for deployment, and they have had many failures while trying to deploy to production. The company has told you deployment process risk mitigation is the most important thing now, and you have a lot of budget for tools and AWS resources. Their stack: 2-tier API, Data stored in DynamoDB or S3 (depending on type), Compute layer is EC2 in Auto Scaling Groups. They use Route53 for DNS pointing to an ELB. An ELB balances load across the EC2 instances. The scaling group properly varies between 4 and 12 EC2 servers.

Writes will miss the cache, since the supermajority will hit the top 1% scores. Knowing we need to set the values roughly equal when using caching, we select AWS ElastiCache, because CloudFront cannot directly cache DynamoDB queries, and ElastiCache is an excellent in-memory cache for database queries, rather than a distributed proxy cache for content delivery. … One solution would be to cache these reads at the application layer. Caching is a technique that is used in many high-throughput applications, offloading read activity on hot items to the cache rather than to the database. Your application can cache the most popular items in memory, or use a product such as ElastiCache to do the same. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GuidelinesForTables.html#GuidelinesForTables.",

You can configure multiple cache behaviors for your web distribution.

      "question": "You need to deploy a new application version to production. Because the deployment is high-risk, you need to roll the new version out to users over a number of hours, to make sure everything is working correctly. You need to be able to control the proportion of users seeing the new version of the application down to the percentage point. You use ELB and EC2 with Auto Scaling Groups and custom AMIs with your code pre-installed assigned to Launch Configurations. There are no database-level changes during your deployment. You have been told you cannot spend too much money, so you must not increase the number of EC2 instances much at all during the deployment, but you also need to be able to switch back to the original version of code quickly if something goes wrong. What is the best way to meet these requirements?",

Over recent months your application has increased in popularity; this has resulted in a decrease in the performance of the application due to the increased load. Your application has a two-tier architecture that is composed of an Auto Scaling PHP application tier and a MySQL RDS instance initially deployed with AWS Cloud Formation. Your Auto Scaling group has a min value of 4 and a max value of 8. The desired capacity is now at 8 because of the high CPU utilization of the instances. After some analysis, you are confident that the performance issues stem from a constraint in CPU capacity, although memory utilization remains low.

The application’s web front-end utilizes an Elastic Load Balancer and Auto scaling across 3 availability zones. During peak load, your web servers operate at 90% utilization and leverage a combination of heavy utilization reserved instances for steady state load and on-demand and spot instances for peak load.

      "question": "To serve Web traffic for a popular product your chief financial officer and IT director have purchased 10 m1.large heavy utilization Reserved Instances (RIs) evenly spread across two availability zones: Route 53 is used to deliver the traffic to an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). After several months, the product grows even more popular and you need additional capacity. As a result, your company purchases two c3.2xlarge medium utilization RIs. You register the two c3.2xlarge instances with your ELB and quickly find that the ml large instances are at 100% of capacity and the c3.2xlarge instances have significant capacity that’s unused.

      "question": "A web-startup runs its very successful social news application on Amazon EC2 with an Elastic Load Balancer, an Auto-Scaling group of Java/Tomcat application-servers, and DynamoDB as data store. The main web application best runs on m2.xlarge instances since it is highly memory-bound. Each new deployment requires semi-automated creation and testing of a new AMI for the application servers which takes quite a while and is therefore only done once per week. Recently, a new chat feature has been implemented in node.js and waits to be integrated in the architecture. First tests show that the new component is CPU bound. Because the company has some experience with using Chef, they decided to streamline the deployment process and use AWS OpsWorks as an application life cycle tool to simplify management of the application and reduce the deployment cycles. What configuration in AWS OpsWorks is necessary to integrate the new chat module in the most cost-efficient and flexible way?",

The previous architect has already deployed a 3-tier VPC.\nThe configuration is as follows:\nVPC vpc-2f8t>C447\nIGW ig-2d8bc445\nNACL acl-2080c448\nSubnets and Route Tables:\nWeb server’s subnet-258bc44d\nApplication server’s subnet-248DC44c\nDatabase server’s subnet-9189c6f9\nRoute Tables:\nrtb-2i8bc449\nrtb-238bc44b\nAssociations:\nSubnet-258bc44d: rtb-2i8bc449\nSubnet-248DC44c: rtb-238bc44b\nSubnet-9189c6f9: rtb-238bc44b\nYou are now ready to begin deploying EC2 instances into the VPC. Web servers must have direct access to the internet. Application and database servers cannot have direct access to the internet. Which configuration below will allow you the ability to remotely administer your application and database servers, as well as allow these servers to retrieve updates from the Internet?",
